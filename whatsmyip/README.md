There's no need to check this code out and run it yourself.  These services are available now!  Go read the [icanhazip FAQ](https://major.io/icanhazip-com-faq/) on my blog for more details.

This is some of the code behind the scenes of some goofy websites like:

* [icanhazip.com](http://icanhazip.com)
* [icanhazptr.com](http://icanhazptr.com)
* [icanhaztrace.com](http://icanhaztrace.com)
* [icanhaztraceroute.com](http://icanhaztraceroute.com)
* [icanhazepoch.com](http://icanhazepoch.com)
* [icanhazproxy.com](http://icanhazproxy.com)

It's Apache 2.0 licensed and it's poorly written code. ;)
